# ðŸ“š Library Management System (Java)

**Development Timeline:** August 1 â€“ September 1, 2025

This is a basic Java library management system that runs on a console.
 Users can search the library's collection, add books, borrow books, and return them.
 I made this project as a personal exercise to get more familiar with Java object-oriented programming, loops, and arrays.
