# ðŸ“š Library Management System (Java)

**Development Timeline:** August 1 â€“ September 1, 2025

This is a simple **console-based Library Management System** written in Java.  
It allows users to add books, borrow them, return them, and search through the library collection.  
I created this project as a personal exercise to practice **arrays, loops, and object-oriented programming** in Java.
