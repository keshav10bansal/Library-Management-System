# ðŸ“š Library Management System (Java)

This is a simple **console-based Library Management System** written in Java.  
It lets users add books, borrow them, return them, and search through the collection.  
I built this project to practice basic Java, arrays, loops, and simple object-oriented programming.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Add Books** â€“ Enter book title, author, category, and number of copies.  
- **View All Books** â€“ See every book in the library with how many copies are available.  
- **Borrow Books** â€“ Borrow a book only if copies are available.  
- **Return Books** â€“ Return a borrowed book and increase the available count.  
- **Search Books** â€“ Search by title, author, or category.

Everything works using basic Java â€” no files, no databases, no advanced features.  
Itâ€™s simple, clean, and easy to understand.
